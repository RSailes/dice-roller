This dice roller is able to take a die of your choosing and roll it as many times as you wish. Other capabilities include:
- Changing your die type
- Changing how many rolls you want
- Rerolling your die
- Getting the total of your last roll

## How it works
1. Enter the die type you wish to use
2. Enter how many rolls you want

After this point, you're able to access a menu to do the previous capabilities mentioned.

> Note: I can add more die types by request, but the default dice accepted at the moment are:
> **D20, D12, D10, D8, D6, D4**
>
> I also plan to add specific rolls such as rolling for damage, hits, etc.
